I've created a website called ["Radar Covid-19 Brasil"](https://covid.luiz-guilherme.com/) using
React and Gatsby to help visualize the [Covid-19 Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic)
data in Brazil.

Besides [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and React, I've also used Gatsby Cloud to build the project automatically
and Netlify to host it. One other interesting piece of technology used was Google Apps Script, used to automatically
updates the website data based on the published data from [Brazilian Ministry of Health](https://saude.gov.br/).
